# Weather-app

It's weather app I created to practice React and fetching, which shows two weather condtions:
1. based on chosen city,
2. based on your geolocation

Used technologies: HTML/Sass/gulp/Bootstrap 4/React

To check random city I added function which is launched when submit button is clicked. 
Geolocation is launched automatically.
Also between them is clock which shows actual date and time.
