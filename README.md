# Weather-app

It's weather app I created to practice React, especially the fetching method, which shows two weather condtions:
1. based on chosen city,
2. based on your geolocation

To check random city I added function which is launched when submit button is clicked. 
Geolocation is launched automatically.
Also between them is clock which shows actual date and time.
After choosing city with submit button, background image is gonna change depends on key-words in "conditions" field.
Website is fully RWD and should be properly displayed on smartphones and tablets.

Used technologies: HTML/Sass/gulp/Bootstrap 4/React
